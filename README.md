# 🖥️ C & Linux Shell Journey  

This repository documents my journey learning **C programming** and **Linux shell scripting**.  
It starts from the very basics and gradually moves toward more complex challenges — including building a small **game in C** 🎮.  

## ✨ Highlights  
- 📂 Step-by-step tasks from beginner to advanced  
- 🧑‍💻 Pure C and shell scripting — no third-party extensions  
- 🎮 A full game project written in C  
- 🐧 Strong focus on Linux fundamentals  

## 🚀 Purpose  
This repo is both a **personal learning archive** and a **reference** for anyone starting out with:  
- C programming basics  
- Shell scripting (`.sh`)  
- Problem-solving and project-building in a low-level environment
